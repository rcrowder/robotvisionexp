 *	This file has some of the stuff that is typically pulled in by the c

 *	the Berkley source code (see notice below).
 *
 *	General notice:
 *	This code is part of a boot-monitor package developed as a generic base
 *	platform for embedded system designs.  As such, it is likely to be
 *	distributed to various projects beyond the control of the original
 *	author.  Please notify the author of any enhancements made or bugs found
 *	so that all may benefit from the changes.  In addition, notification back
 *	to the author will allow the new user to pick up changes that may have
 *	been made by other users after this version of the code was distributed.
 *
 *	Note1: the majority of this code was edited with 4-space tabs.
 *	Note2: as more and more contributions are accepted, the term "author"
