# I pulled down the latest (as of this writing) version of zlib.
# I was suspicious that the older zlib was doing something wrong (based on
# feedback from a user).  This update didn't change anything, so now I'm
# suspicious that there was pilot error on the part of the user.
# Anyway, since I went through the pain of integrating this version into
# uMon it is now in CVS and available for others to use by simply
# changing the ZLIBDIR entry in make/common.make to zlib-1.2.3.
# 
# My notes during the update:
#
# - Started with a subset of the zlib files (those needed for decompression
#   only).
# - Changed crc32.c and crc32.h to zcrc32.c/zcrc32.h.  Made the same changes
#   in the code (added #define crc32 zcrc32 to zlib.h).
# - Pulled out all the code that is omitted as a result of -DNO_GZCOMPRESS.
# - This library only supports decompression; hence, no need for the compress
#   stuff.
