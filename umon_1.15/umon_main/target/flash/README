Two directories: boards & devices

boards:
	Each directory below 'boards' contains one configuration of flash
	on a board.  Some of the boards simply have one flash device, while
	others have several.  Note that this is the older flash code and
	while it isn't required, it is recommended that the 'devices' directory
	be used for new MicroMonitor ports.
	As of this writing (5/6/2005), the drivers in this directory have not
	been updated for compatibility with uMon1.0.  There is no current
	plan to bring these up-to-date, they are part of this tree for 
	reference only.

devices:
	Each .c file represents one configuration of one particular flash
	device.  These files can be used standalone or mixed, depending on
	the configuration of the board.  Refer to devices/README for full
	details.
	Not all driver files have been updated to conform with uMon1.0.
	The easiest way to determine if the driver has been updated to 
	uMon1.0 is to look at the relocatable xxx_lock() function.  If
	it supports the FLASH_LOCKABLE operation properly, then it has
	been updated to be uMon1.0 compatible.

Note that several of these drivers may need updating.
Especially notable is the need for the WATCHDOG_MACRO to be inserted
in strategic points within the driver.  Obviously this will only be
needed if the hardware runs with a watchdog.
