These files are environment setup examples that come with the 
MicroMonitor distribution.  Copy these to $UMONTOP/host/bin and
make the appropriate modifications.

bashrc_port:
	This is template bashrc file that would be used with a new
	port of MicroMonitor.  If you already have a port, then the
	bashrc file in that port-specific directory is already in place
	and this file is not needed.

vcc_setup:
	Used to establish the Visual C++ environment if the MicroMonitor
	host-based tools are being built with VCC.

umon_setup:
	Called by every port-specific bashrc file.  Usually there is no
	need to modify umon_profile, just copy it to $UMONTOP/host/bin.
	It assumes it is being executed after the port-specific bashrc
	file, so it takes what it needs from that setup.
