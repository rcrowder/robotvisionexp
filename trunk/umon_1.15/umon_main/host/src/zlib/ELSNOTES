1. Unzipped this from zlib.zip.
2. Ran configure (under bash).
3. Ran make... didn't work, so I built my own makefile and used nmake.
	Created the makefile based on the output of make on the sun.
	(could have used a modified version of the makefile under nt directory)
4. Make now works.
5. Removed extra stuff that was not needed for this build (all can be 
	restored from zlib.zip if necessary).
