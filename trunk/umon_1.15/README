Welcome to MicroMonitor!

This is the top-level of the MicroMonitor CVS.

There are three main directories:
umon_main:
  This is the common code reusable on various targets as the core
  of MicroMonitor's functionality.
umon_ports:
  This directory contains the public ports of MicroMonitor.  Each
  subdirectory contains the makefile and target-specific code for
  one uMon port.
umon_apps:
  This code provides a few different application examples for use
  after the bootmonitor is built and running on your target.  The
  best place to go there is umon_apps/demo.  This directory contains
  the source and makefile that support building a basic application
  for any target supported by MicroMonitor.  

To get started, refer to umon_main/README.
