This directory contains source and makefile to build a small
uMon-resident application that runs the uIP stack from Adam Dunkels.
The basic uMon hookup code is the same as the demo directory under
umon_apps/demo; however, instead of being a generic demo, this focusses
on uIP demos.

The uip code was downloaded from the uIP homepage 
(http://www.sics.se/~adam/uip/index.php/Main_Page) on Apr 8, 2008.

As of this writing, the makefile supports convenient build for
the hello-world, telnetd and webserver applications as they come
with uIP.  The file main.c has all the hooks that allow uIP to work
essentially out-of-the-box when running as a uMon application.

Run 'make APP=HELLO' to build the hello-world demo.
Run 'make APP=HETTPD' to build the webserver demo.
Run 'make APP=TELNETD' to build the telnetd demo.

As of this writing, this has been tested only on the PPC architecture.
To run on other CPUs, the clock_time() function in main.c needs to
be created.  If you use this for some other processor and create the
cpu-specific timer function, please consider contributing it back to the
uMon distribution.

Refer to makefile for details on how to build for various CPU architectures
and target configurations.  That is essentially identical to the umon_apps
demo application.
