This directory contains source and makefile to build  the
'jffs2' command as a standalone application for a uMon-based
target.  It depends on being in the context of a complete uMon source
tree, so this directory is not stand-alone.

The jffs2_le.bin and jffs2_be.bin files can be put into TFS on the target
and used by the jffs2 command as a dummy jffs2 flash area just for
demonstration.  Also, the jffs2_script is an example of how jffs2 would
be used in a real system to query for the presence of a file.

Refer to makefile for details on how to build for various CPU architectures
and target configurations.
