This directory contains source and makefile to build a small
uMon-resident application that carry's out some of the CFI
(Common Flash Interface) specification. 

Note that this can be built for a variety of targets, but does
require that the peer directory "demo" be present.

Refer to makefile for details on how to build for various CPU
architectures and target configurations.
