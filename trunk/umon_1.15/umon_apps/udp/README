This directory contains source and makefile to build a small
uMon-standalone application that demonstrates the use of uMon's
ethernet packet interface as the basis for simple UDP communications.

This is code that is taken directly from uMon source, only here it is
modified to use the monitor's API functions.  This code should be 100%
independent of the target; hence, provides an immediate mechanism for a
board running uMon to have a basic application using UDP.

Refer to makefile for details on how to build for various CPU architectures
and target configurations.
