This is an example of a VERY-VERY cut-back version of uMon (called
uuMon, or MicroMicroMonitor) for use in a ridiculously memory-limited
system as a serial-port only bootloader.

It fits in under 16K total space (text/data/bss/stack) and provides
xmodem data transfer, DM, PM, MT and CALL commands.

This version is built to run on the CSB637 and assumes that
basic IO is already initialized.

The target-specific portions of this build are in cpuio.c and crt0_arm.S.
All other portions of the code should be independent of the target.
